# Press ‚åò+R to build and run

## Project Structure

```text
MacClipboard/
  MacClipboardApp.swift     App entry point & delegate
  ClipboardMonitor.swift    Clipboard tracking & history
  MenuBarController.swift   Status item, popover, hotkey
  ContentView.swift         SwiftUI UI components
  UserPreferences.swift     Settings persistence
  Assets.xcassets/          Icons & assets
```

## Technical Details

**Clipboard Monitoring**: Uses `NSPasteboard.general` with change count polling every 0.5 seconds for reliable clipboard tracking.

**Content Support**:

* Text via `NSPasteboard.string(forType: .string)`
* Images via `NSImage` pasteboard objects
* Files via `NSURL` pasteboard objects

**Global Hotkey**: Implemented using Carbon framework's `RegisterEventHotKey` for system-wide `Cmd+Shift+V` support.

**Data Storage**: Clipboard history stored in memory only (not persisted between app launches for privacy).

**UI Framework**: Native SwiftUI with `NSHostingController` embedded in `NSPopover` for modern, responsive interface.

## Privacy & Security

* **No network access**: All data stays on your Mac
* **No persistent storage**: History cleared when app quits
* **Secure by design**: Only accesses clipboard when content changes
* **Minimal permissions**: Only needs accessibility for hotkey

## Goals

* Fast, responsive clipboard access
* Native macOS look and feel
* Minimal resource usage
* Privacy-focused design
* Simple but powerful interface

## Non-Goals

* Cloud sync or backup
* Advanced text editing
* Clipboard encryption
* Cross-platform support

## Contributing

PRs welcome for:

* Bug fixes and stability improvements
* Performance optimizations
* UI/UX enhancements (keeping simplicity in mind)
* Additional content type support

Please keep changes focused and maintain the lightweight philosophy.

## Troubleshooting

**Global hotkey not working?**

* Check System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility
* Ensure MacClipboard is allowed

**App not capturing clipboard?**

* Try quitting and restarting the app
* Check if another clipboard manager is running

**Can't see menu bar icon?**

* The icon appears as a clipboard symbol in your menu bar
* Try adjusting menu bar item spacing in System Settings
